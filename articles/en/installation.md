## Installation

Welcome to the Vanilla OS installation guide. This guide will walk you through the steps to install Vanilla OS on your system.

### System Requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- A 64-bit processor
- At least 4GB of RAM
- At least 20GB of free disk space
- A USB drive with at least 4GB of capacity

### Download the ISO

1. Go to the [Vanilla OS website](https://vanillaos.org) and download the latest ISO file.
2. Once the download is complete, create a bootable USB drive using a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

### Boot from the USB Drive

1. Insert the bootable USB drive into your computer.
2. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings. This is usually done by pressing a key like F2, F12, or Delete during startup.
3. Change the boot order to prioritize the USB drive.
4. Save the changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI settings. Your computer should now boot from the USB drive.

### Install Vanilla OS

1. Once the system boots from the USB drive, you will see the Vanilla OS installer. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Vanilla OS on your system.
2. Select your language, keyboard layout, and time zone.
3. Choose the installation type. You can either install Vanilla OS alongside your existing operating system or replace it entirely.
4. Partition your disk if necessary. The installer will guide you through this process.
5. Create a user account and set a password.
6. Review your settings and click "Install" to begin the installation process.

### Post-Installation

1. Once the installation is complete, remove the USB drive and restart your computer.
2. Log in to your new Vanilla OS installation with the user account you created during the installation process.

### First Setup
